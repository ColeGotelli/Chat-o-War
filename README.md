# Chat-o-War
TwitchCon Hackathon 2018
This project is a Twitch Extension that any streamer can use to engage more with their chat.
The streamer can type in a question and set the two options and the users can click the button for the 'team' they want to support.
The more votes one option gets, the more that teams bar fills up and decreases the other teams bar.
When the streamer decides to end the poll, the extension determines which team won and celebrates them.
