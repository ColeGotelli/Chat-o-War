# Chat-o-War
TwitchCon Hackathon 2018
This project is a Twitch Extension that any streamer can use to engage more with their chat.
The streamer can type in a question and set the two options and the users can like the button for the 'team' they want to support.
The more votes one option gets, the more that teams bar fills up and decreases the other teams bar.
Voting will be open for 1 minute and at the end of that time, the extension determines which team won and then fills the entire bar followed by playing an animation of a specific emote raining down over the stream
